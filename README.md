# Description
The program can craw some public security vulnerablility websites and detect inconsistencies of software version.

# Dependence
    Python >=3.6
# User Guide
If you're in China, you need cross the Great Wall to make the program(craw_report.py) craw some blocked websites(e.g. arch/info website). I use shadowsocks to run the program. Use `proxychains` to force the program run with the proxy in linux or use shadowsocks with "全局模式" in windows.

## linux
If you need to cross the wall in linux, run the program like this:

    proxychains python entry.py

If you don't need to cross the wall in linux, run the program like this:  
    
    python entry.py

## windows
 Run the program in windows like this(if you need cross the wall, use shadowsocks with "全局模式"):
    python entry.py
